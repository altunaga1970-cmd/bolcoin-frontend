    "a_what_need": "You need: (1) A cryptocurrency wallet like MetaMask, (2) USDT tokens on the Polygon network, and (3) A small amount of MATIC for transaction fees. That's it!",
    "q_get_usdt": "How do I get USDT on Polygon?",
    "a_get_usdt": "You can: (1) Bridge USDT from Ethereum or other networks using the Polygon Bridge, (2) Buy USDT directly on exchanges that support Polygon withdrawals (like Binance, Kraken, or Coinbase), or (3) Swap other tokens for USDT on decentralized exchanges like QuickSwap or Uniswap.",
    "q_min_deposit": "Is there a minimum deposit or bet?",
    "a_min_deposit": "There is no deposit - the platform is non-custodial. Minimum bets are 1 USDT for all games. La Fortuna tickets cost 1 USDT each.",
    "q_non_custodial": "What is a non-custodial platform?",
    "a_non_custodial": "Non-custodial means we never hold your funds. All transactions happen directly between your wallet and our smart contracts on the blockchain. You always maintain full control of your money.",
    "q_games_available": "What games are available?",
    "a_games_available": "We offer two games: La Bolita (number betting with 2, 3, or 4 digit numbers) and La Fortuna (lottery-style game with 6 numbers + key number).",
    "q_when_draws": "When are draws held?",
    "a_when_draws": "La Bolita draws happen 3 times daily: 10:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC. La Fortuna draws are twice weekly: Wednesday and Saturday at 20:00 UTC.",

    "q_know_won": "How do I know if I won?",
    "a_know_won": "Check the Results page after each draw. Your wallet address will show any prizes you've won. You can also view your betting history in your profile.",
    "q_claim_winnings": "How do I claim my winnings?",
    "a_claim_winnings": "For La Bolita wins, you can claim directly from the smart contract. For La Fortuna, larger draws may use a Merkle tree claim system - you'll receive a proof to claim your prize.",
    "q_deadline": "Is there a deadline to claim prizes?",
    "a_deadline": "Yes, prizes must be claimed within 90 days of the draw. After that, unclaimed prizes return to the prize pool.",
    "q_jackpot_cap": "What is the jackpot cap?",
    "a_jackpot_cap": "The La Fortuna jackpot has a cap of $1,000,000 USDT. When reached, additional contributions go to the prize pool instead.",
    "q_fair_results": "How do I know the results are fair?",
    "a_fair_results": "Keno uses a SHA-256 provably fair system with server seed, client seed, and nonce. Each game result can be verified via the /api/keno/verify/:gameId endpoint. See our Provably Fair page for details.",
    "q_manipulate": "Can Bolcoin manipulate results?",
    "a_manipulate": "No. Keno results are computed from pre-committed seeds using SHA-256 hashing. The operator cannot find a seed that produces a desired outcome. Each game can be independently verified.",

    "q_wallets_supported": "Which wallets are supported?",
    "a_wallets_supported": "Any wallet that supports the Polygon network works with La Bolita. We recommend MetaMask, but WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and others also work.",
    "q_why_matic": "Why do I need MATIC?",
    "a_why_matic": "MATIC is the native token of Polygon and is required to pay for transaction fees (gas). Don't worry - Polygon fees are very low, typically less than $0.01 per transaction.",
    "q_tx_stuck": "My transaction is stuck. What do I do?",
    "a_tx_stuck": "Polygon transactions usually confirm within seconds. If stuck, try: (1) Increasing gas price in your wallet, (2) Waiting a few minutes for network congestion to clear, or (3) Checking the transaction status on PolygonScan.",
    "q_website_down": "What happens if the website goes down?",
    "a_website_down": "Your funds are safe on the blockchain, not on our servers. You can always interact directly with the smart contracts using PolygonScan or another interface.",
